// 1. Program Excuetable is at package main/func main()
// 2. Blank Identifier: Use _ to replace unused variables.
// 3. there are two primitive ways to allocate to a pointer, new() and make(), they differ though, we will discuss that later, briefly new returns pointer, make return value. read Doc.
// 4. Every thing is passed by value except arrays, slices, maps and channels which some calls reference types, these types are passed by reference ( they internally have pointers, so no copying of the actual data happens when passing them) .
// 5. Unlike in C, it's perfectly OK to return the address of a local variable; the storage associated with the variable survives after the function returns.
